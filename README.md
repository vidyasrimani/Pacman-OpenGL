# Pacman-OpenGL

Graphics is an extremely effective medium to communicate. This field has been growing rapidly over the years. Its applications are seen in various fields as humans can understand what is said diagrammatically better than what is given in terms of numbers and text. 

Pac-man is a classic arcade game that was released in 1980. It has been declared the arcade game with the highest video awareness. Even though it was released three decades ago, it is still played by many with the same enthusiasm.Its simplicity, ease of use and ability to keep the user hooked on to it for long has been responsible for this enormous popularity. In our project we have tried to recreate this game using OpenGL.

Our prime focus was interaction and animation. The application allows the user to control the movement of pac-man by using the keyboard. To mimic the animation presented to us in the original game, we made use of affine transformations. Using various transformations like rotate and translate to move the pac-man and monsters, we give the illusion of animation.

The layout of the board differs slightly from the original game. We have experimented with a 
different color scheme and rendered it with different lightings. Visually different from the 
inspiration, it still holds the essence of the game.
