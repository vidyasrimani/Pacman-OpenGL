INBUILT FUNCTIONS

1.	glutInit(&argc, argv)
The interaction betwwen the windowing system and openGL is initiated. The arguments allow the user to pass command-line arguments.

2.	glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA|GLUT_DOUBLE|GLUT_DEPTH)
The color scheme used follows RGB format. Depth is enabled for hidden surfaces and  double buffers are used. ‘A’ or alpha  specifies the opacity.

3.	glutInitWindowSize(int width, int height)
Specifies the height and width of the window in pixels.

4.	glutInitWindowPosition(int x-co-ordinate, int y-co-ordinate)
Specifies the position of the window using co-ordinates.

5.	glutCreateWindow(“WindowTitle”)
Creates the window with the given title.

6.	glutDisplayFunc(void (*func)(void))
It registers the display function that is executed when the window needs to be redrawn.

7.	glutSwapBuffers()
Swaps the front and back buffers. The front buffer is always the one displayed, whereas the back buffer if the one into which we draw.

8.	glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix()
Depending on the matrix mode, stack contents are modified.

9.	glEnable()
It enables different functions in OpenGL. For instance, the keyboard function can be enabled.

10.	glMatrixMode()
It specifies the matrix that is modified. The matrices can be GL_MODELVIEW , GL_PROJECTION or GL_TEXTURE.

11.	glLoadIdentity()
It sets the current transformation matrix to an identity matrix.

12.	glBegin(mode)
It initiates new primitive of type mode.  The modes can be GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, GL_LINE_LOOP.

13.	gluLookAt(cop_x,cop_y,cop_z,at_x,at_y,at_z,up_x,up_y,up_z)
Set the position of the camera depending on parameters specified.

14.	gluPerspective (field_of_view,aspect_ratio,near,far)
Set viewing in perspective mode as specified by the parameters.
